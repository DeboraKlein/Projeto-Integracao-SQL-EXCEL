## View Structure: `VENDAS_INTERNET`

#### CREATE VIEW VENDAS_INTERNET
```sql
CREATE VIEW VENDAS_INTERNET AS
SELECT
    fis.SalesOrderNumber AS [ORDER_NO],
    fis.OrderDate AS [ORDER_DATE],
    dpc.EnglishProductCategoryName AS [PRODUCT_CATEGORY],
    dc.FirstName + ' ' + dc.LastName AS [CUSTOMER_NAME],
    dc.Gender AS [GENDER],
    dst.SalesTerritoryCountry AS [COUNTRY],
    fis.OrderQuantity AS [QUANTITY_SOLD],
    fis.TotalProductCost AS [SALE_COST],
    fis.SalesAmount AS [SALE_REVENUE]
FROM FactInternetSales fis
INNER JOIN DimProduct dp ON fis.ProductKey = dp.ProductKey
INNER JOIN DimProductSubcategory dps ON dp.ProductSubcategoryKey = dps.ProductSubcategoryKey
INNER JOIN DimProductCategory dpc ON dps.ProductCategoryKey = dpc.ProductCategoryKey
INNER JOIN DimCustomer dc ON fis.CustomerKey = dc.CustomerKey
INNER JOIN DimSalesTerritory dst ON fis.SalesTerritoryKey = dst.SalesTerritoryKey
WHERE YEAR(fis.OrderDate) = 2013
````

#### Adding Profit Margin to the View
````sql
ALTER VIEW VENDAS_INTERNET AS
SELECT
    fis.SalesOrderNumber AS [ORDER_NO],
    fis.OrderDate AS [ORDER_DATE],
    dpc.EnglishProductCategoryName AS [PRODUCT_CATEGORY],

    CASE 
        WHEN fis.SalesAmount = 0 THEN 0
        ELSE ROUND((fis.SalesAmount - fis.TotalProductCost) / fis.SalesAmount, 2)
    END AS [PROFIT_MARGIN]

### Analytical Queries
#### 1. Sales by Product Category
````sql
SELECT PRODUCT_CATEGORY, SUM(QUANTITY_SOLD) AS TOTAL_SALES
FROM VENDAS_INTERNET
GROUP BY PRODUCT_CATEGORY
````
#### 2. Revenue by Month
````sql
SELECT MONTH(ORDER_DATE) AS MONTH, SUM(SALE_REVENUE) AS TOTAL_REVENUE
FROM VENDAS_INTERNET
GROUP BY MONTH(ORDER_DATE)
ORDER BY MONTH
````
#### 3. Revenue and Cost by Country
````sql
SELECT COUNTRY, SUM(SALE_REVENUE) AS TOTAL_REVENUE, SUM(SALE_COST) AS TOTAL_COST
FROM VENDAS_INTERNET
GROUP BY COUNTRY
````
#### 4. Sales by Gender
````sql
SELECT GENDER, SUM(QUANTITY_SOLD) AS TOTAL_SALES
FROM VENDAS_INTERNET
GROUP BY GENDER
````
## Advanced Analysis
#### 1. Average Ticket per Customer
````sql
SELECT 
    CUSTOMER_NAME,
    COUNT(ORDER_NO) AS TOTAL_ORDERS,
    SUM(SALE_REVENUE) AS TOTAL_REVENUE,
    AVG(SALE_REVENUE) AS AVERAGE_TICKET
FROM VENDAS_INTERNET
GROUP BY CUSTOMER_NAME
ORDER BY AVERAGE_TICKET DESC
````
#### 2. Top-Selling Products
````sql
SELECT 
    dp.EnglishProductName AS PRODUCT,
    SUM(fis.OrderQuantity) AS TOTAL_QUANTITY
FROM FactInternetSales fis
JOIN DimProduct dp ON fis.ProductKey = dp.ProductKey
WHERE YEAR(fis.OrderDate) = 2013
GROUP BY dp.EnglishProductName
ORDER BY TOTAL_QUANTITY DESC
````
#### 3. Revenue vs. Cost by Category
````sql
SELECT 
    PRODUCT_CATEGORY,
    SUM(SALE_REVENUE) AS REVENUE,
    SUM(SALE_COST) AS COST,
    SUM(SALE_REVENUE - SALE_COST) AS PROFIT
FROM VENDAS_INTERNET
GROUP BY PRODUCT_CATEGORY
ORDER BY PROFIT DESC
````
`#### 4. Sales Distribution by Age Group
````sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN YEAR(GETDATE()) - YEAR(dc.BirthDate) BETWEEN 18 AND 25 THEN '18-25'
        WHEN YEAR(GETDATE()) - YEAR(dc.BirthDate) BETWEEN 26 AND 35 THEN '26-35'
        WHEN YEAR(GETDATE()) - YEAR(dc.BirthDate) BETWEEN 36 AND 50 THEN '36-50'
        ELSE '51+'
    END AS AGE_GROUP,
    COUNT(*) AS TOTAL_CUSTOMERS,
    SUM(fis.SalesAmount) AS TOTAL_REVENUE
FROM FactInternetSales fis
JOIN DimCustomer dc ON fis.CustomerKey = dc.CustomerKey
WHERE YEAR(fis.OrderDate) = 2013
GROUP BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN YEAR(GETDATE()) - YEAR(dc.BirthDate) BETWEEN 18 AND 25 THEN '18-25'
        WHEN YEAR(GETDATE()) - YEAR(dc.BirthDate) BETWEEN 26 AND 35 THEN '26-35'
        WHEN YEAR(GETDATE()) - YEAR(dc.BirthDate) BETWEEN 36 AND 50 THEN '36-50'
        ELSE '51+'
    END
````
#### 5. Average Time Between Orders per Customer
````sql
WITH CustomerOrders AS (
    SELECT 
        CustomerKey,
        OrderDate,
        LAG(OrderDate) OVER (PARTITION BY CustomerKey ORDER BY OrderDate) AS PreviousOrder
    FROM FactInternetSales
    WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = 2013
),
DaysBetween AS (
    SELECT 
        CustomerKey,
        DATEDIFF(DAY, PreviousOrder, OrderDate) AS DaysBetweenOrders
    FROM CustomerOrders
    WHERE PreviousOrder IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
    CustomerKey,
    AVG(DaysBetweenOrders) AS AVG_DAYS_BETWEEN_ORDERS
FROM DaysBetween
GROUP BY CustomerKey
````
#### 6. Top 5 Customers by Revenue
Table generated in Excel from the VENDAS_INTERNET view, connected via Power Query. Used to identify customers with the highest value per order.

Fields used:

- CUSTOMER_NAME

- TOTAL_ORDERS (Count of ORDER_NO)

- TOTAL_REVENUE (Sum of SALE_REVENUE)

- AVERAGE_TICKET (Total Revenue Ã· Total Orders)

Key Performance Indicators (KPI Cards)


#### 1. Total Revenue
````sql
SELECT SUM(SALE_REVENUE) AS TOTAL_REVENUE FROM VENDAS_INTERNET
````
#### 2. Total Cost
````sql
SELECT SUM(SALE_COST) AS TOTAL_COST FROM VENDAS_INTERNET
````
#### 3. Total Profit
````sql
SELECT SUM(SALE_REVENUE - SALE_COST) AS TOTAL_PROFIT FROM VENDAS_INTERNET
````
#### 4. Total Orders
````sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ORDER_NO) AS TOTAL_ORDERS FROM VENDAS_INTERNET
````
`#### 5. Average Ticket
````sql
SELECT 
    SUM(SALE_REVENUE) / COUNT(DISTINCT ORDER_NO) AS AVERAGE_TICKET
FROM VENDAS_INTERNET
````
